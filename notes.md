# JS
---
- Dynamic, weakly-typed programming language
- Interpreted "on the fly" compiled language
- "Hosted language": Runs in different environments (e.g. in browser)
- Most prominent use-case is running code in a browser
- The V8 engine runs JavaScript in Chrome, in Firefox its SpiderMonkey, these engines parse code, compile it to machine code, and then executes the machine code (this all happens on a single thread)
- Being dynamic and interpreted means that code can change at runtime, even the type of a variable
- Data types are assumed automatically
- Google's JS Engine, V8, was extracted to run JS anywhere (Node.js)
- NodeJS can be executed on any machine so it is often used to build web backends
- NodeJS can access the local filesystem, interact with the OS, etc. It CANT manipulate HTML or CSS like JavaScript can (because it does not have direct access to the browser? Or maybe just not access to the front end, either way the syntax is the same)
